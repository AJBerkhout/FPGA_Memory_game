-connect the board with the right most switch in the high position (up). That switch is the reset switch.
-Connect the board to the vga cable and the vga cable to a monitor.
-Program the device and it should start on its own. 

-the four buttons represent the four white, stationary notes on the screen. Press them when a purple note overlaps and your score will increase
-the 2 left most slide switches can change the speed the note go pass. Both of them high is the hardest mode.
